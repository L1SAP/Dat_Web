# Dat_Web

This is my first creation. I started this project to learn coding and design.

The site is inspired by my grandfather's dream of opening a Vietnamese restaurant. Creating this website has been fun, allowing me to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I'll continue to update and refine the site as I learn more.
